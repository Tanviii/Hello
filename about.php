<p><h1>Introduction</h1><p>
<br>
<br>

<p><h2>1.1  Existing System<p>
<br>
The basic system for travel and tourism is the on paper method. This requires the user to manually visit agency providing the facility. 
Also many online systems have been developed which include techniques of integrating online booking system with the travel website. The booking system here is made by a different source and is then integrated into the system. 
The current trend observed in the existing systems is the real-time booking. The existing systems also provides multiple ways to make a payment.

<p><h2>1.2  Disadvantages of Existing System<p>
<br>
Users(Customers) provide their personal details , which include their email-id ,contact no to the system. Thus a system needs to maintain the system security. The existing system has a high risk of compromising user data which is a matter of concern.
GUI also plays an important role in the online mode. The Graphical User Interface needs to be more interactive and attractive at the same time. The existing systems lack at this prospect of providing a good front end to the users.

<p><h2>1.3  Problem Statement<p>
<br>
It has been observed that there is a need for a system that can reduce the work of the user and also provide an efficient and easy way of booking their tours.
The proposed Online System aims at providing all the necessities of a good online system.</h2>

<p><h1>Chapter 2- Analysis</h1><p>
<br>

<p><h2>2.1  Survey of Existing System in Detail<p>
<br>
The existing system is available online but not fully automated. The user is sometimes required to give invoice to confirm payment or confirm the travel. In such case the user experiences discomfort in manually completing the process.
The information displayed on the website should be all sufficient but the existing system gives insufficient details. The GUI is also not attractive to provide a good impact on the user.
Customer Service/Help is also an important factor. If the user wishes to give his/her Feedback of a tour for others users to see, it should be provided for him/her by the system. This helps not only other users but also the developers for making proper changes.

<p><h2>2.2  Findings and Analysis/Comparison of Existing and Proposed System<p>
<br>
As the existing system does not provide full automation, our existing system provides automation. The system allows users to pay online. Also Booking and Cancellation of the tour is very easy. The user can do it in a convenient way.
Our System also provides an attractive graphical interface. All the information of the system is provided in a proper manner with attractive images.
The system is easy and efficient as well as it maintains  a proper database of the existing users.
